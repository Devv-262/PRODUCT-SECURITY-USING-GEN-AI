    [CRITICAL] Container Security Context User Group ID
        · go-app -> The container is running with a low user ID
            A userid above 10 000 is recommended to avoid conflicts with the
            host. Set securityContext.runAsUser to a value > 10000
        · go-app -> The container running with a low group ID
            A groupid above 10 000 is recommended to avoid conflicts with the
            host. Set securityContext.runAsGroup to a value > 10000
    [CRITICAL] Container Security Context Privileged
        · go-app -> The container is privileged
            Set securityContext.privileged to false. Privileged containers can
            access all devices on the host, and grants almost the same access as
            non-containerized processes on the host.
    [CRITICAL] Container Ephemeral Storage Request and Limit
        · go-app -> Ephemeral Storage limit is not set
            Resource limits are recommended to avoid resource DDOS. Set
            resources.limits.ephemeral-storage
        · go-app -> Ephemeral Storage request is not set
            Resource requests are recommended to make sure the application can
            start and run without crashing. Set
            resource.requests.ephemeral-storage
    [CRITICAL] Pod NetworkPolicy
        · The pod does not have a matching NetworkPolicy
            Create a NetworkPolicy that targets this pod to control who/what
            can communicate with this pod. Note, this feature needs to be
            supported by the CNI implementation used in the Kubernetes cluster
            to have an effect.
    [CRITICAL] Container Image Pull Policy
        · go-app -> ImagePullPolicy is not set to Always
            It's recommended to always set the ImagePullPolicy to Always, to
            make sure that the imagePullSecrets are always correct, and to
            always get the image you want.
    [CRITICAL] Container Security Context ReadOnlyRootFilesystem
        · go-app -> The pod has a container with a writable root filesystem
            Set securityContext.readOnlyRootFilesystem to true
    [CRITICAL] Deployment has PodDisruptionBudget
        · No matching PodDisruptionBudget was found
            It's recommended to define a PodDisruptionBudget to avoid
            unexpected downtime during Kubernetes maintenance operations, such
            as when draining a node.
    [WARNING] Deployment has host PodAntiAffinity
        · Deployment does not have a host podAntiAffinity set
            It's recommended to set a podAntiAffinity that stops multiple pods
            from a deployment from being scheduled on the same node. This
            increases availability in case the node becomes unavailable.
